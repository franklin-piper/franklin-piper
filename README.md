👋 Hi, I’m Franklin Piper. I plan to graduate in December 2024 from Buffalo State University with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems
- 👀 I’m interested in Linguistics, Learning new things and methods for sending SMS messages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning LINQ, Python and home networking
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects, games and a C# library for linguistics to allow for representing linguistic concepts with OOP.

- ⚡ Fun fact: <i>There are Australian Aboriginal languages that don't have relative direction (left, right, etc) and instead use
  absolute cardinal direction instead. They can have a North and a South hand or an East and a West hand.</i>
